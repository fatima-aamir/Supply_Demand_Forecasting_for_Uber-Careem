# Supply_Demand_Forecasting_for_Uber-Careem
The code performs data analysis and feature engineering tasks, for example, extricating time, year, month, day, and hour data from the dataset utilizing datetime capabilities. This assists in making extra elements that with canning be utilized for additional examination and demonstrating. It uses uses various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and Ada Boost
Regressor for predicting the target variable based on the features.
The code utilizes different assessment measurements, for example, accuracy_score, mean_absolute_error, mean_squared_error, and r2_score to assess the presentation of the prepared models. These measurements help in estimating the exactness and prescient force of the models.
## Optimization:
The model was optimized using a grid search for hyperparameter tuning, and the best-performing model was selected based on cross-validation results.
## Results:
The best-performing Random Forest Regression model was selected based on the grid search results, and it was used to make predictions on the test dataset.
